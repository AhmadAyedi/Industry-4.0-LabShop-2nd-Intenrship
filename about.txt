be carefully the client wont receive the correct path in order_success.html 
file because the path we gave him is this one:
http:/server's IP_address/ecommerce10/client_side/update_progress.php and 
then his credential id

so if you change the directory of your project you must change it in the code
(order_success.html) as well
